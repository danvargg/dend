# Project: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Introduction

A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a **directory of JSON logs** on user activity on the app, as well as a **directory with JSON metadata** on the songs in their app.

They need a data engineer to create a **Postgres** database with tables designed to **optimize queries on song play analysis.** Our role is to create a **database schema** and **ETL pipeline** for this analysis. Then we'll test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare our results with their expected results.

## Description

In this project, We'll apply the concepts learned in data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will define **fact and dimension tables** for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using **Python** and **SQL.**

## Data

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are **partitioned by the first three letters** of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```python
data/song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
data/song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file,`TRAAAAW128F429D538.json`, looks like.

```python
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARD7TVE1187B99BFB1", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "California - LA", "artist_name": "Casual", "song_id": "SOMZWCG12A8C13C480", "title": "I Didn't Mean To", "duration": 218.93179, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are **partitioned by year and month.** For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```python
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file (subset of the file), `2018-11-01-events.json`, looks like.

```python
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Walter","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Frye","length":null,"level":"free","location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA","method":"GET","page":"Home","registration":1540919166796.0,"sessionId":38,"song":null,"status":200,"ts":1541105830796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"39"}
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Summers","length":null,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"GET","page":"Home","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":null,"status":200,"ts":1541106106796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"}
{"artist":"Des'ree","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":1,"lastName":"Summers","length":246.30812,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":"You Gotta Be","status":200,"ts":1541106106796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"}
```

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, we'll create a star schema optimized for queries  on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays, i.e., records with page `NextSong`
    - `songplay_id`, `start_time`, `user_id`, `level`, `song_id`, `artist_id`, `session_id`, `location`, `user_agent`

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - Following information about users:
    - `user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `level`

3. **songs** - Following info about songs:
    - `song_id`, `title`, `artist_id`, `year`, `duration`

4. **artists** - Artists information:
    - `artist_id`, `name`, `location`, `latitude`, `longitude`

5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    - `start_time`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `weekday`

In order to create these tables, all we need to do is perform some transformation in the data which are already in song_data and log_data directory.

## Song Data Processing

We will perform ETL on the files in *song_data* directory to create two dimensional tables: `songs` table and `artists` table.

For songs table, we'll extract data for songs table by using only the columns corresponding to the songs table suggested in the star schema above. Similarly, we'll select the appropriate columns for artists table.

```python
song_data = df[["song_id", "title", "artist_id", "year", "duration"]].values[0]
array(['SOMZWCG12A8C13C480', "I Didn't Mean To", 'ARD7TVE1187B99BFB1', 0, 218.93179], dtype=object)

artist_data = df[["artist_id", "artist_name", "artist_location", "artist_latitude", "artist_longitude"]].values[0]
array(['ARD7TVE1187B99BFB1', 'Casual', 'California - LA', nan, nan], dtype=object)
```

Now insert the extract data into their respective tables.

```python
cur = conn.cursor
# insert songs data
cur.execute(song_table_insert, song_data)
conn.commit()

# insert artists data
cur.execute(artist_table_insert, artist_data)
conn.commit()
```

Variables `song_table_insert` and `artist_table_insert` are **PostgreSQL** queries. These are given in `sql_queries.py` file.

## Log Data Processing

We will perform ETL on the files in `log_data` directory to create the remaining two dimensional tables: `time` and `users`, as well as the `songplays` fact table.

For `time` table we have `ts` column in log files. We will parse it as a time stamp and use python's datetime functions to create the remaining columns required for the table mentioned in the above schema.

```python
# filter specifies that user has played a song
df = df[df.page == "NextSong"]

# converting to timestamp
t = pd.to_datetime(df['ts'], unit='ms')

# creating different unit based on hour, day, etc.
time_data = [t, t.dt.hour, t.dt.day, t.dt.week, t.dt.month, t.dt.year, t.dt.weekday]

# specifying column names for the same
column_labels = ['timestamp', 'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year', 'weekday']

# creating a separate df
time_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dict(zip(column_labels, time_data)))
```

For `users` table, we'll extract the appropriate columns from log files as mentioned in the star schema above for `users` table.

```python
user_df = df[['userId', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'gender', 'level']] 
```

For `songplays` table, we will require information from `songs` table, `artists` table and the original log files. Since the log files do not have `song_id` and `artist_id`, we need to use `songs` table and `artists` table for that. The *song_select* query finds the `song_id` and `artist_id` based on the *title, artist_name,* and *duration* of a song. For the remaining columns, we can select them from the log files.

```python
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    
    # get songid and artistid from song and artist tables
    results = cur.execute(song_select, (row.song, row.artist, row.length))
    songid, artistid = results if results else None, None
    
    starttime = pd.to_datetime(row.ts,unit='ms')
        
    # insert songplay record
    songplay_data = (index, starttime, row.userId, row.level, songid, artistid, row.sessionId, row.location, row.userAgent)
    cur.execute(songplay_table_insert, songplay_data)
    conn.commit()
```

Now insert the data into their respective tables.

```python
# insert into time table
for i, row in time_df.iterrows():
    cur.execute(time_table_insert, list(row))
    conn.commit()

# insert into users table
for i, row in user_df.iterrows():
    cur.execute(user_table_insert, row)
    conn.commit()
```
